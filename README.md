# open_biomeched
This package hosts a web-app that extracts 2D kinematic data from a video. The app automatically takes the video uploaded and produces an anotated video with the detected landmarks, and a .csv file with the coordinates of 33 landmarks on the body. 

The app can be accessed without cloning the git repo by visiting the link below:
